# Getting Started
- The course is meant to be a primer of the fundamentals of SQL
- Identify SQL Syntax, common statemnets, and terminology

- Identify common keywords.

# Selecting and Retreiving Data with SQL
## Module Objectives
- Define and discuss how SQL differs from other ocmputer languages
- Discuss how SQL is used within databases.
- Compare and contrast the roels of a database administrator and data scientist.
- Explaion data relationships within databases
	- 1:1, 1:Many, and Many:Many relationships.
- Use the `SELECT` statement
- Learn syntax rules
- Discuss benefitrs of commenting within your code.

## What is SQL Anyway?
- SQL, or Structured Query Language, is a standard computer language for relational database managemetn and data manipulation.
- Used to query, insert, update, and modify data.

- SQL is all about daa
- Read/Retieve data
- Write data - add data to ta table

	- Backend Developer
	- QA Engineer
	- Database Admin (DBA)
	- Data Analyst
	- System Admin
	- Data Architect
	- ETL Developer

- Database Adminitrator vs Data Scientist
	- Database Admin
		- Manages/ Governs entire database
		- Gives permissions to userts
		- Determines access to data
		- Manages and creates tables
		- *Uses SQL to query and retreive data*
	- Data Scientist
		- End user of a database
		- *Uses SQL to query and retreive data*

## How do Data Scientists use SQL?
- Retreive Data
- May create their own table or test environment
- Combine multiple sources together 
- Writes complex querties for analysis

## SQL and Database Management Systems
- How you write syntax will depend on what DBMS you are using
- Each DBMS has its own dialect
- SQL can translate
- You will tweak based on the dialect your DMBS speaks
- Popular Relationsal Database Management Systems
	- Microsoft SQL Server
	- IBM DB2 Oracle
	- Sybase ASE
	- PostrgreSQL
	- MySQL
